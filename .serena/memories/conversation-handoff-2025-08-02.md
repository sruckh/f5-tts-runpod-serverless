# Conversation Handoff - F5-TTS Storage Architecture Fix

**Date**: 2025-08-02

## Summary
This conversation focused on correcting the storage architecture of the F5-TTS project. The primary goal was to ensure that AI models are loaded from the persistent `/runpod-volume` at runtime, rather than being incorrectly included in the container image.

## Current State
- The `Dockerfile.runpod` has been corrected to remove the invalid model pre-loading steps.
- The `runpod-handler.py` has been updated to a more robust, synchronous architecture and now correctly loads models from `/runpod-volume`.
- The project's documentation (`TASKS.md` and `JOURNAL.md`) has been updated to reflect these changes.
- A memory file, `f5-tts-storage-architecture-correction-2025-08-02.md`, has been created to document the architectural correction.
- All changes have been committed and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.

## Next Steps
The project is now in a state where it can be correctly built and deployed by the RunPod CI/CD system. The next logical step is to trigger a new build and verify that the deployment is successful and that the serverless endpoint is functioning as expected.
