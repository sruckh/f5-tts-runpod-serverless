The `Dockerfile.runpod` was updated to correct the `pip install` path. The `git clone ... .` command clones the repository's contents into the current working directory, so the `pip install -e .` command must be run from that same directory. The Dockerfile was corrected to run `pip install -e .` in the `/app` directory, which is the correct location for the `setup.py` file.
