# F5-TTS Runtime Installation with WhisperX Integration - 284b0d6 Reset

## Overview
Successfully reset to commit 284b0d6 and implemented runtime installation architecture with WhisperX integration for word-level timing extraction.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dockerfile.runpod Fixes
**Fixed syntax errors and architecture:**
- **Line 43**: Removed quotes from `transformers>=4.48.1` (was causing escaping issues)
- **Line 45**: Changed `python-ass` to `ass` (correct module name)
- **Architecture Change**: Moved heavy modules from build-time to runtime installation
- **Lightweight Base**: Container now only includes essential dependencies (runpod, boto3, requests, librosa, soundfile, ass)

### 2. Runtime Installation System
**Heavy modules now installed at runtime:**
- `flash_attn` - Specific CUDA 12.x wheel for performance
- `transformers>=4.48.1` - Hugging Face transformers
- `google-cloud-speech` - Google Cloud Speech API
- `whisperx` - WhisperX for advanced word-level timing

**Installation Logic:**
- Check if module already available before installing
- Use subprocess.check_call for reliable installation
- Proper error handling and status reporting
- GPU memory management for WhisperX models

### 3. WhisperX Integration
**New Function: `extract_word_timings_whisperx()`**
- **Primary Method**: WhisperX for accurate word-level timing extraction
- **Forced Alignment**: Uses wav2vec2 alignment models for precision
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic language detection and model selection
- **GPU Optimization**: Proper model cleanup and memory management
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback to Google Speech API if WhisperX fails

**Features:**
- Batch processing with configurable batch size (16)
- Compute type optimization (float16 for CUDA, int8 for CPU)
- Word-level confidence scores
- Language detection and reporting
- Method identification in response

### 4. API Enhancements
**New Parameter: `timing_method`**
- `whisperx` (default) - Use WhisperX for timing extraction
- `google` - Use Google Speech API directly
- Automatic fallback from WhisperX to Google if needed

**Response Enhancements:**
- `timing_method` - Reports actual method used (including fallbacks)
- `language` - Detected language from WhisperX
- Enhanced error reporting and status messages

## Technical Benefits

### Performance Optimizations
- **Smaller Base Image**: Reduced container size by moving heavy modules to runtime
- **Faster Cold Starts**: Only essential dependencies in base container
- **Better Memory Management**: WhisperX models properly cleaned up after use
- **GPU Efficiency**: Automatic device detection and compute type optimization

### Reliability Improvements
- **Fallback Strategy**: WhisperX → Google Speech API → Error
- **Installation Resilience**: Check existing modules before installation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting at each stage
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and GPU memory

### Accuracy Improvements
- **WhisperX Precision**: Superior word-level timing accuracy vs standard Whisper
- **Forced Alignment**: Explicit audio-text alignment for precise timestamps
- **Language Support**: Multi-language support with automatic detection
- **Confidence Metrics**: Word-level confidence scoring

## API Usage Examples

### Basic TTS with WhisperX Timing
```json
{
  "input": {
    "text": "Hello world, this is a test.",
    "return_word_timings": true,
    "timing_method": "whisperx",
    "timing_format": "srt"
  }
}
```

### Google Speech API Timing
```json
{
  "input": {
    "text": "Hello world, this is a test.",
    "return_word_timings": true,
    "timing_method": "google",
    "timing_format": "vtt"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Notes
- **GPU Requirements**: CUDA-compatible GPU for WhisperX optimization
- **Memory**: ~6-8GB GPU memory recommended for WhisperX models
- **Network**: Initial runtime installation requires internet access
- **Volume**: /runpod-volume/models for persistent model caching

## Troubleshooting
- WhisperX installation failures will fallback to Google Speech API
- Heavy module installation logged with detailed status messages
- GPU memory issues handled with proper cleanup procedures
- Model loading errors reported with full stack traces

## Integration with Previous Architecture
- Maintains compatibility with existing S3 storage system
- Preserves all existing endpoints (upload, list_voices, download)
- Continues to support all existing timing formats (SRT, VTT, CSV, JSON, ASS)
- Maintains secure presigned URL system for file downloads
