# F5-TTS API Parameter Constructor Fix - 2025-08-01

## Issue Summary
F5-TTS model loading failed with `TypeError: F5TTS.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'model_name'` during container deployment.

## Root Cause Analysis
The F5TTS constructor signature in the current API expects `model` as the parameter name, not `model_name`. Previous modernization efforts used incorrect parameter naming based on outdated documentation.

## Technical Fix Applied
**File**: `runpod-handler.py:55`  
**Change**: Updated F5TTS initialization from:
```python
f5tts = F5TTS(model_name=model_name, device=device)
```
to:
```python
f5tts = F5TTS(model=model_name, device=device)
```

## API Documentation Reference
Based on official F5-TTS API source code from GitHub, the constructor signature is:
```python
def __init__(self, model="F5TTS_v1_Base", ckpt_file="", vocab_file="", ode_method="euler", use_ema=True, vocoder_local_path=None, device=None, hf_cache_dir=None)
```

## Impact
- ✅ Resolves constructor compatibility issue with current F5-TTS releases
- ✅ Enables successful model initialization in RunPod containers
- ✅ Maintains modern API integration established in previous tasks
- ✅ No functional changes to inference logic required

## Task Context
- **Task ID**: TASK-2025-08-01-003
- **Phase**: API Enhancement & Production Readiness (continued)
- **Dependencies**: Built upon TASK-2025-08-01-002 (F5-TTS API Modernization)
- **Status**: Complete and tested

## Documentation Updates
- Updated TASKS.md with new task entry and completion status
- Added JOURNAL.md entry with technical details and resolution summary
- Created this memory for future reference and troubleshooting

## Prevention Measures
Future F5-TTS API updates should verify parameter names against official source code rather than relying on documentation which may lag behind implementation changes.
