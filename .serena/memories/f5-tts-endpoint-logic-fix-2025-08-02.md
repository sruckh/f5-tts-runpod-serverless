# F5-TTS API Endpoint Logic Fix

## Task Summary
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-08-02-003

This task involved fixing a critical bug in the `runpod-handler.py` where the new `/download` endpoint was causing issues with the voice reference download logic.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. `runpod-handler.py`
- Changed the `if endpoint == "upload":` statement to `elif endpoint == "upload":`. This ensures that the endpoint logic is correctly chained and only one endpoint is executed per request.

## Reason for Changes
- The `if endpoint == "download":` block was not properly chained with the other endpoint logic, causing the code to fall through and execute the TTS generation logic unintentionally. This was preventing reference voices from being downloaded correctly.
