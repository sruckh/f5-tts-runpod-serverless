### Feature Enhancements
- **What**: Added S3 storage, asynchronous job tracking, and new API endpoints.
- **Why**: To provide a more robust and feature-rich TTS service.
- **How**: Implemented `boto3` for S3 integration, a dictionary to track job status, and new endpoints in the `runpod-handler.py`.
- **Issues**: The `replace_regex` tool was not working as expected, so I had to use a different approach to modify files.
- **Result**: The serverless worker now supports S3 storage, job tracking, and new endpoints for uploading voice models, checking job status, and retrieving results.
