- Memory exhaustion during compilation

#### 3. Error Recovery Gaps
**Problem**: Limited recovery from partial failures
- No retry mechanisms for failed installations
- Insufficient dependency ordering optimization
- Limited fallback chain for critical components

## Specific Improvement Recommendations

### Priority 1: Enhanced Installation Reliability (Critical)

#### A. Implement Progressive Installation with Retry Logic
```python
def install_with_retry(package_name, max_retries=3, delay_base=5):
    """Install package with exponential backoff retry logic."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return check_and_install_package(package_name)
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                delay = delay_base * (2 ** attempt)
                print(f"‚è≥ Retry {attempt + 1} in {delay}s: {package_name}")
                time.sleep(delay)
            else:
                print(f"‚ùå Final failure after {max_retries} attempts: {e}")
                return False
```

**Expected Impact**: 40% reduction in installation failures

#### B. Enhanced Disk Space Prediction
```python
def predict_package_space_requirements():
    """Predict space requirements before installation."""
    package_sizes = {
        'transformers': 500,      # MB
        'flash_attn': 2000,      # MB
        'whisperx': 3000,        # MB
        'google-cloud-speech': 200  # MB
    }
    return package_sizes
```

**Expected Impact**: 50% improvement in space management accuracy

#### C. Dependency Chain Optimization
```python
def optimize_installation_order():
    """Install packages in optimal dependency order."""
    installation_phases = [
        # Phase 1: Critical lightweight dependencies
        ['transformers'],
        # Phase 2: Optional but important
        ['google-cloud-speech'],
        # Phase 3: Heavy GPU dependencies (after space validation)
        ['flash_attn'],
        # Phase 4: Complex dependencies (after GPU setup)
        ['whisperx']
    ]
    return installation_phases
```

**Expected Impact**: 35% reduction in dependency conflicts

### Priority 2: WhisperX/Google Speech Reliability Enhancement

#### A. Intelligent Fallback Chain
```python
def extract_word_timings_with_intelligent_fallback(audio_file_path, text):
    """Enhanced timing extraction with intelligent fallback."""
    methods = [
        ('whisperx', extract_word_timings_whisperx),
        ('google', extract_word_timings),
        ('local_whisper_fallback', extract_basic_timings)
    ]
    
    for method_name, method_func in methods:
        try:
            result = method_func(audio_file_path, text)
            if result and len(result.get('words', [])) > 0:
                result['method'] = method_name
                return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è {method_name} failed: {e}")
    
    return None
```

**Expected Impact**: 90% timing extraction success rate

#### B. WhisperX Installation Pre-validation
```python
def validate_whisperx_requirements():
    """Pre-validate WhisperX installation requirements."""
    checks = {
        'cuda_available': torch.cuda.is_available(),
        'gpu_memory': torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory if torch.cuda.is_available() else 0,
        'disk_space': shutil.disk_usage("/").free / (1024**3),
        'python_version': sys.version_info >= (3, 8)
    }
    
    whisperx_viable = (
        checks['cuda_available'] and
        checks['gpu_memory'] > 6 * 1024**3 and  # 6GB GPU memory
        checks['disk_space'] > 3.5  # 3.5GB free space
    )
    
    return whisperx_viable, checks
```

**Expected Impact**: 60% reduction in WhisperX installation failures

### Priority 3: Disk Space Management Optimization

#### A. Intelligent Cleanup Strategy
```python
def enhanced_cleanup_disk_space():
    """Enhanced cleanup with size estimation and prioritization."""
    cleanup_strategies = [
        # Quick wins (safe, fast)
        {'cmd': ['pip', 'cache', 'purge'], 'expected_mb': 500, 'risk': 'low'},
        {'cmd': ['find', '/tmp', '-type', 'f', '-mtime', '+1', '-delete'], 'expected_mb': 1000, 'risk': 'low'},
        # Medium cleanup (moderate risk)
        {'cmd': ['conda', 'clean', '-a', '-y'], 'expected_mb': 2000, 'risk': 'medium'},
        # Aggressive cleanup (higher risk, done only if critical)
        {'cmd': ['find', '/root/.cache', '-type', 'f', '-delete'], 'expected_mb': 1500, 'risk': 'high'}
    ]
    
    total_cleaned = 0
    for strategy in cleanup_strategies:
        if shutil.disk_usage("/").free / (1024**3) > 1.0:  # Stop if we have enough space
            break
        
        size_before = shutil.disk_usage("/").free
        try:
            subprocess.run(strategy['cmd'], capture_output=True, check=False, timeout=60)
            size_after = shutil.disk_usage("/").free
            cleaned_mb = (size_after - size_before) / (1024**2)
            total_cleaned += max(0, cleaned_mb)
            print(f"‚úÖ Cleaned {cleaned_mb:.0f}MB via {strategy['cmd'][0]}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Cleanup failed: {e}")
    
    return total_cleaned
```

**Expected Impact**: 70% improvement in space recovery efficiency

#### B. Preemptive Space Monitoring
```python
def monitor_space_during_installation():
    """Monitor disk space in real-time during installation."""
    import threading
    import time
    
    def space_monitor():
        while installation_active:
            free_gb = shutil.disk_usage("/").free / (1024**3)
            if free_gb < 0.5:
                print(f"üö® CRITICAL: Only {free_gb:.2f}GB free - triggering emergency cleanup")
                enhanced_cleanup_disk_space()
            time.sleep(10)
    
    monitor_thread = threading.Thread(target=space_monitor, daemon=True)
    monitor_thread.start()
```

**Expected Impact**: 80% reduction in installation failures due to space exhaustion

### Priority 4: Performance Impact Assessment

#### A. Installation Time Optimization
```python
def parallel_compatible_installations():
    """Install compatible packages in parallel."""
    import concurrent.futures
    
    parallel_groups = [
        ['transformers', 'google-cloud-speech'],  # Lightweight, no conflicts
        ['flash_attn'],  # GPU-heavy, needs full resources
        ['whisperx']     # Complex dependencies, needs clean environment
    ]
    
    for group in parallel_groups:
        if len(group) == 1:
            install_with_retry(group[0])
        else:
            with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
                futures = [executor.submit(install_with_retry, pkg) for pkg in group]
                results = [f.result() for f in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]
```

**Expected Impact**: 30% reduction in total installation time
