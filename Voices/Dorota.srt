00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,960
Hey, hey, thanks.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,160
Happy Friday.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,040
I have received your information.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,920
Thank you so much.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,680
This weekend, I have to tell you, as soon as Akashka is here for another four weeks, so to be honest with you, I probably will not even think about that because I want to spend some quality time with her.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,800
Not to mention, she twisted her ankle in the most severe way.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,720
So I'm helping her quite a bit.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,800
And 20 pictures, I have to be honest with you, that's a lot.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,160
I don't have 20 pictures.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
I don't normally take pictures of myself.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,640
That's not, it's never been my thing.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,000
Front, back.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
And I mean, what you're requesting to me right now is little much.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,120
I'm so sorry.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,120
I'm just being honest.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:51,200
So eventually at some point, I will look at what I have, but I've never had like full-size pictures front and back.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
And I just, it's just, I'm not, I'm not a person that likes to take pictures of myself.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,880
So that's challenging.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:08,480
And for me to actually spend time doing that, it's just not doesn't make me very happy about it.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,680
So, but listen, I'm all about, I'm really excited to hear about this potential of AI.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,760
And if there's other ways that you can show me its capacity, that would be really lovely.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,360
Maybe we can find another way or maybe we can use somebody else.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
That would be great.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,760
Anyway, let me know what you think.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:38,400
And I will, yeah, I will connect with you shortly.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,440
And then, yeah, I will definitely look at when, like, essentially, time where you can come visit.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
With my sister being here, we're all over the place.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,360
Even in her condition, I just want to be one-on-one with her.

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,000
And then once she leaves, then I will have my work schedule and then we can collaborate.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
Well, obviously, we'll check your schedule, mine, and we'll figure something out.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,640
So, yeah, I have not forgotten about that.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm still serious about that.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
So, all right, my friend.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,680
In the meantime, keep on smiling.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,040
Take good care.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,760
Take care of yourself in a positive way.

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,280
Try to avoid negative self-talks and do things that make you happy on a daily basis.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:23,920
All right.

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,040
Take care of yourself.

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,080
Okay, Pa.
