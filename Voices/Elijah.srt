1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,800
I was alone in the office elevator, heading down after a long day.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,920
Just as the doors were closing, a hand shot through.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,920
An older man in a gray suit jumped in, smiling politely.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,200
We descended in silence until the lights flickered and the elevator jerked to a stop.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,640
I sighed, thinking great, just my luck.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,360
The man calmly pressed the emergency button.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,320
I tried making small talk to break the tension.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,240
He nodded, but didn't say much.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
Just stood there quickly, hands folded.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,680
Or quietly, not messing all up.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,480
Minutes later, the elevator resumed.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
As we reached the ground floor, he turned to me and said, thanks for the company.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,720
Not many people talk to me anymore.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,440
I smiled awkwardly, but when I looked back as he walked away, he was gone.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
And the security guard said no one had entered the building in hours.
