1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,120
But it was open to that, it wasn't even closed off to that.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,800
So, even if he wasn't teaching it, it was open to those areas.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,440
Practices, standing, and he would go ride the bike, remember, until it started hurting his butt.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,120
But he would take sage for a walk when we would give him sage.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,040
Yeah, that one looks like it's falling off.

00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,560
Did you put it on the right way?

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,440
It kind of looks like you put him on the opposite way.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,360
Like, mine have the like opposite side, the side of the thing, like this is like this side versus this side.
