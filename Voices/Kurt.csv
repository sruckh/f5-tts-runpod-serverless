62.24,77.76,"Samuel scribbled furiously in his notebook, capturing the sensation of sounds, the flutter of pigeons ascending into the blue sky, the guttural grumble of an old man complaining about the meandering bus, and the sharp clatter of bicycle chains in motion."

109.52,111.60,His world brimmed with marvels.
111.92,126.64,"The round vowels of British English circling gracefully like a dance, the nasal twang of the American Midwest resonating through conversation, and the crisp precision of Australian syllable stresses marking the edges of words."

164.00,173.36,"Perhaps the language is, Samuel paused, speaking aloud to himself before finishing, the perfect reflection of humanity's complexities."
173.92,185.68,"From the cheerful explanation of a street vendor yelling about warm pretzels, to the melancholy sigh of a weary traveler sitting quietly on a park bench, the city was an orchestra of identity."
