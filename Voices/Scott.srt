1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
Good morning.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,720
My name is Alex, and today is a brand new day filled with possibility.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,160
Whether the sky is blue or blanketed in clouds, I always start with a warm cup of coffee, a deep breath, and a curious mind.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,200
Some day big surprises, other simple routines, but I greet them all the same.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Every sound around me tells a story.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,640
The chirping of birds, the hum of distant traffic, the soft ticking of a clock.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,280
Words carry weight, rhythm, and purpose.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,360
From a whisper to a shout, language flows with color and feeling.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,840
Imagine walking through a bustling market.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,560
The aroma of spices drifts through the air.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
A child laughs, a vendor calls out, fresh fruit, just picked this morning.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
Every voice is unique, shaped with experiences, accents, and mood.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,720
I speak clearly and with intention, articulating each syllable with care.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,400
From vowels that stretch wide, like owl, and ice, to consonants that click and pop like crisp and snap.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,240
Every sound has its place.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,600
Thank you for listening.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,520
I look forward to the next time we speak.
